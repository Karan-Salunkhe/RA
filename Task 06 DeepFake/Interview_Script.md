## 🎙️ INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT  

### Q1 – Standout Batter of the Season  
> REPORTER: Sachin, great to have you with us. To begin, who, according to you, was the standout batter of IPL 2025?  

SACHIN: Sai Sudharsan really stood out. With 759 RUNS 🏏 in 15 matches at an AVERAGE of 54.21, he was consistent and anchored the Gujarat Titans’ batting beautifully.  

---

### Q2 – Strike Rate vs. Total Runs  
> REPORTER: And if we talk about pure strike rate, Nicholas Pooran hit nearly 196 🚀 this season. Do you think strike rate is more valuable than total runs?  

SACHIN: Both matter, but context is key. Pooran’s strike rate is incredible — it changes the game in just 20 BALLS. But for a full season, someone like Sudharsan gives you stability. Ideally, a team needs a BALANCE OF BOTH.

### Q3 – Kohli vs. Bumrah Contributions  
> REPORTER: Let’s compare contributions. Virat Kohli scored 657 RUNS, while Jasprit Bumrah contributed with the ball, effectively saving almost 293 RUNS for Mumbai. Who do you think had a bigger impact?  

SACHIN: It’s tough to compare bat and ball directly, but I’d lean towards KOHLI. 657 RUNS at a healthy average in pressure situations — it’s priceless. That said, Bumrah’s impact in crunch overs can’t be measured just in numbers.  

---

### Q4 – Mohammed Siraj’s Workload  
> REPORTER: Looking at bowlers, Mohammed Siraj bowled 57 OVERS, the most this season. What does that tell you about his role?  

SACHIN: It shows his captain trusts him in ALL PHASES — new ball, middle overs, and death. That’s not easy. His workload was huge, but he handled it well.  

---

### Q5 – Building a Playoff Team  
> REPORTER: If you were building a playoff team today, which 5 BATTERS and 3 BOWLERS would you pick?  

SACHIN: I’d pick:  
- BATTERS ⚡: Sudharsan, Pooran, Surya, Gill, Klaasen  
- BOWLERS 🎯: Bumrah, Noor Ahmad, Hazlewood  

That’s a CHAMPION LINEUP — a great mix of stability, aggression, pace, and spin.
