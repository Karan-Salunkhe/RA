# Extended Deep Fake Interview Script – Sachin Tendulkar on IPL 2025

---

**Reporter:** Sachin, great to have you with us. To begin, who, according to you, was the standout batter of IPL 2025?  

**Sachin:** Sai Sudharsan really stood out. With **759 runs at an average of 54.21**, he was consistent and anchored the Gujarat Titans’ batting beautifully.  

---

**Reporter:** And if we talk about pure strike rate, Nicholas Pooran hit nearly **196** this season. Do you think strike rate is more valuable than total runs?  

**Sachin:** Both matter, but context is key. Pooran’s strike rate is incredible—it changes the game in just 20 balls. But for a full season, someone like Sudharsan gives you stability. Ideally, a team needs a balance of both.

**Reporter:** Let’s compare contributions. Virat Kohli scored **657 runs**, while Jasprit Bumrah contributed with the ball, effectively saving almost **293 runs** for Mumbai. Who do you think had a bigger impact?  

**Sachin:** It’s tough to compare bat and ball directly, but I’d lean towards Kohli. **657 runs at a healthy average in pressure situations**—it’s priceless. That said, Bumrah’s impact in crunch overs can’t be measured just in numbers.  

---

**Reporter:** Looking at bowlers, Mohammed Siraj bowled **57 overs**, the most this season. What does that tell you about his role?  

**Sachin:** It shows his captain trusts him in all phases—new ball, middle overs, and death. That’s not easy. His workload was huge, but he handled it well.  

---

**Reporter:** If you were building a playoff team today, which **5 batters and 3 bowlers** would you pick?  

**Sachin:** I’d pick **Sudharsan, Pooran, Surya, Gill, and Klaasen** for batting—great mix of stability and aggression. For bowling, **Bumrah, Noor Ahmad, and Hazlewood** give me pace, spin, and control. That’s a champion lineup.
