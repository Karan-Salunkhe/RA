# Research Task 06 – AI Deep Fake Interview (IPL 2025 Season)

📌 **Overview**  
This project is **Research Task 06**, which builds upon the dataset analysis and LLM comparison from **Task 05**.  

In Task 05, I analyzed the **IPL 2025 dataset** (batters & bowlers), designed natural language prompts, compared ChatGPT and DeepSeek outputs with Pandas validation, and summarized descriptive statistics.  

Task 06 takes those insights and transforms them into a **deep fake video interview** using **Descript**. The interview imagines a post-season conversation between a sports reporter and **Sachin Tendulkar**, reflecting on standout performances, strike rates, wicket-takers, and team-building scenarios based on IPL 2025 statistics.

## 🏏 Task 06 Objective  
- Create a narrative interview script using dataset-driven insights from Task 05.  
- Generate an AI-powered **video interview** using Descript with distinct voices for interviewer and Sachin Tendulkar.  
- Document the workflow, including tools attempted, challenges faced, and final solution.  
- Deliver a realistic “media-style” interview blending **statistical facts, scenarios, and personal opinions**.

## 🛠 Workflow & Approaches  

### Tools Explored  
- **ChatGPT** → Helped refine the Q&A interview script, combining stats + scenario-based questions.  
- **D-ID & HeyGen** → Explored for lip-synced avatar interviews, but free trials too limited.  
- **CapCut/Canva** → Considered for editing with stock footage, but required more manual syncing.  
- **Descript** → Final choice. Allowed text-to-speech with realistic AI voices, multi-speaker dialogue, and exportable video.  

---

### ✅ Final Workflow  
1. Drafted the extended **interview script** (reporter + Sachin Tendulkar).  
2. Imported script into **Descript**, assigning one AI voice to Reporter and another to Sachin.  
3. Generated separate dialogue tracks and aligned them as a back-and-forth conversation.  
4. Exported the full **deep fake video interview** in `.mp4` format.

## 📊 Reflection  
This task allowed me to:  
- Convert raw **statistical insights (Task 05)** into a **human-style interview**.  
- Experiment with multiple AI tools for deepfake generation, noting free vs. paid limitations.  
- Learn how to **synchronize narrative, stats, and AI voices** into a believable media interaction.  
- Deliver a final product that highlights both **data-driven accuracy** and **realistic storytelling**.  

The process emphasized that while **Descript** was not perfect, it provided the most flexible free/student-friendly way to create a video interview with distinct AI voices.
