## 📌 Introduction  

This report consolidates **Research Task 04, Task 05, and Task 06** into a single integrated deliverable. The goal of Task 07 is to demonstrate technical proficiency in scripting and data analysis, critical thinking, validation of AI outputs, and the ability to transform data into stakeholder-facing narratives.  

The sequence of tasks reflects a **real-world analytics pipeline**:  

1. **Task 4** → Build a robust data analysis foundation (CSV Analyzer).  
2. **Task 5** → Validate Large Language Model (LLM) responses against real IPL 2025 cricket data.  
3. **Task 6** → Translate validated insights into a human-centered media-style narrative.  

By linking these stages, this report illustrates the journey from **raw data → insights → actionable communication**.  

---

## 🔹 Task 4 – CSV Analyzer  

### Objective  
To design and implement a **Pandas-based CSV Analyzer** that can handle structured and semi-structured (JSON-like) CSV data, generate descriptive statistics, and allow optional aggregation.  

### Methodology  
- **Detection of JSON Columns** → Scans columns using regex for `{}` patterns.  
- **Unpacking JSON Columns** → Uses `ast.literal_eval` and `pd.json_normalize` to flatten nested structures.  
- **Numeric Summaries** → Computes Count, Mean, Min, Max, StdDev.  
- **Text Summaries** → Computes Count, Unique Values, Top Value & Frequency.  
- **Aggregation** → Optionally group by categorical columns and compute mean of numeric columns.  

### Why This Step Was Done  
This step provided a **reusable foundation** for dataset analysis and ensured consistent, trustworthy statistics for subsequent LLM validation in Task 5.  

### Summary of Task 4  
Task 4 produced a **universal CSV analysis engine**, allowing IPL cricket data to be efficiently unpacked, summarized, and grouped. This ensured reliability for future AI validation and narrative construction.  

---

## 🔹 Task 5 – Descriptive Statistics & LLM Validation  

### Objective  
To evaluate the accuracy of ChatGPT and DeepSeek when answering natural language queries about the **IPL 2025 cricket dataset**, and to validate outputs against the Pandas script from Task 4.  

### Methodology  
1. **Dataset** → IPL 2025 season: batting and bowling statistics.  
2. **Question Design** → Natural language queries (Q1–Q6).  
3. **LLM Comparison** → Responses generated by ChatGPT and DeepSeek.  
4. **Validation** → Numeric outputs validated using Pandas script.  
5. **Documentation** → Comparison tables and detailed records of outputs.  

### Key Results  

| Q# | Question | ChatGPT Answer | DeepSeek Answer | Script Answer |
|----|-----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | Highest strike rate (>500 runs) | Nicholas Pooran – SR 196.2, Runs 524 | Nicholas Pooran – SR 196.25, Runs 524 | **196.25** |
| 2 | Kohli vs Bumrah contributions | Kohli (with narrative) | Kohli (657 > 293.3) | **657 / 293.3** |
| 3 | Most overs bowled | Siraj – 57 overs (342 balls) | Siraj – 57 overs | **57** |
| 4 | Team-building under pressure | Pooran + Bumrah | Hardik Pandya | N/A |
| 5 | Playoff picks | Pooran, SKY, Iyer, Sudharsan, Klaasen + Noor, Bumrah, Hazlewood | Pooran, Gill, Iyer, Klaasen, SKY + Bumrah, Rashid, Noor | N/A |
| 6 | Young bowler with potential | Noor Ahmad – 24 wickets, SR 12.5 | Noor Ahmad – 24 wickets, SR 12.5 | **24 / 12.5** |

### Insights  
- Numeric outputs match script-validated results; interpretive answers diverge.  
- Pandas validation ensured **trustworthiness**.  
- LLMs are **accurate for descriptive stats**, less consistent on judgment calls.  

### Why This Step Was Done  
To **stress-test LLMs against a trusted pipeline** and demonstrate the need for validation when producing actionable insights.  

### Summary of Task 5  
LLMs are reliable for numeric queries, but Pandas validation is critical for interpretive claims. Task 5 highlights **the importance of combining AI reasoning with verified data**.  

---

## 🔹 Task 6 – Deep Fake Interview  

### Objective  
To convert Task 5 insights into a **stakeholder-facing narrative** using a simulated post-season media interview with Sachin Tendulkar.  

### Methodology  
1. Draft interview script using key statistics from Task 5.  
2. Test AI video tools: D-ID, HeyGen, CapCut, Canva.  
3. Use **Descript** for final video: assign AI voices, align dialogue, export `.mp4`.  

### Why This Step Was Done  
Task 6 demonstrates **how validated insights can be transformed into engaging narratives** for stakeholders, media, and fans.  

### Summary of Task 6  
Task 6 produced a **data-driven, human-friendly narrative**, showing practical translation of numeric insights into communication.  

---

## 🔹 Task 7 – Integration and Final Reflection  

### Strengths Across Tasks  
- Task 4 → Technical foundation for analysis  
- Task 5 → LLM validation against numeric data  
- Task 6 → Narrative and stakeholder communication  

### Challenges  
- LLM interpretive divergence  
- Limited free tools for AI media generation  
- Balancing numeric rigor with narrative clarity  

### Lessons Learned  
1. Validation is critical  
2. Narratives enhance stakeholder comprehension  
3. Tool choice impacts workflow efficiency  

### Practical Applications  
- Sports coaching and decision-making  
- Media content generation  
- Academic demonstration of analytics workflow  

### Summary of Task 7  
End-to-end analytics pipeline from **raw data → AI insights → validated narrative → stakeholder-ready outputs** is achievable and reproducible.
